# A HTML/CSS Homepage for Horiseon, a fictional Marketing Agency

## Intro
The Horiseon homepage is a demonstration of basic CSS and HTML concepts. While not complex, the underlying code is meant to be readable, clean, and easy for other developers to modify. It also attempts to be accessible to users with screen readers by including alt texts for images and semantic HTML tags.

## Usage
This HTML5-based webpage will work in any modern browser (Mozilla, Chrome, Edge, Opera, etc) but may behave strangely in Internet Explorer and other, older browsers.  
It is hosted on GitHub Pages and can be accessed here: https://jkohrt7.github.io/HW1_Horiseon_marketing/  

## Credit  
Much of the original webpage was provided by Trilogy Education Services as part of the UNC Full-Stack Coding Bootcamp.
